# Credit Suisse Coding Challenge 2020

### Leaderboard is coming soon.

### [Questions and my Solutions](./Questions) 

After 3 years of entering the Credit Suisse Coding Challenge, this was my final year. Hope you all enjoyed it as much as I did.

I don't know where I land or others until the "Officials" verify scores, but will add the leaderboard and other stats soon.

So today, 6pm on the 9th of November 2020, marks the last Credit Suisse "Student" Coding Challenge for me. But everyone who has or hasn't, give it a great attempt in my spirit in the years to come.
